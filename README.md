# IS-IA1 - Nmap

ðŸ”¹ Nmap-Based Network Scanner
This project is a Python-based network security tool that integrates Nmap functionalities to perform port scanning, service detection, OS fingerprinting, and vulnerability assessment. It provides both CLI and GUI implementations.

ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented
âœ” Port Scanning â€“ Identifies open, closed, and filtered ports to assess network security.
âœ” Service Detection â€“ Retrieves software versions of running services to detect outdated or vulnerable applications.
âœ” OS Detection â€“ Uses OS fingerprinting techniques to determine the operating system of a target machine.
âœ” Vulnerability Scanning â€“ Detects misconfigurations, weak security settings, and outdated software using Nmap scripts.
âœ” Customizable Scans â€“ Users can specify target IPs, port ranges, and scanning options.
âœ” GUI Interface (Tkinter) â€“ A user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction.
âœ” CLI Support â€“ Full control over scanning parameters for automation and scripting.
âœ” Multithreading Support â€“ Ensures the GUI remains responsive during long scans.
âœ” Real-Time Output â€“ Dynamically displays scan results in a scrollable text box.
